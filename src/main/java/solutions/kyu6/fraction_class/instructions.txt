You are provided with a skeleton of the class 'Fraction', which accepts two arguments (numerator, denominator).

EXAMPLE:

Fraction fraction1 = new Fraction(4, 5);
Your task is to make this class string representable, and addable while keeping the result in the minimum
representation possible.

EXAMPLE:

System.out.println(fraction1.add(new Fraction(1, 8)));
// Outputs: 37/40
NB: DON'T use the built_in class 'fractions.Fraction'

Enjoy!
