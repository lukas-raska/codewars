Task:
Write a function that creates a Euler square for any odd positive integer n. Your function will be tested for odd n < 200.

A Euler square (also called a Graeco-Latin square) is a pair of orthogonal latin squares. A latin square is an n Ã— n
array filled with the integers 1 to n each occurring once in each row and column - see Latin Squares. Two latin  squares
 are orthogonal if each r between 1 and n in the 1st square is paired (i.e. occurs at the same position) exactly  once
 with each s between 1 and n in the 2nd square.

Example of Euler Square of size 3:
[[3,1,2],      [[3,2,1],
 [2,3,1],       [2,1,3],
 [1,2,3]],      [1,3,2]]

Explanation:
1 in the 1st square is paired with 2 in the first row of the 2nd square, with 3 in the second row, and with 1 in the
third row.
2 in the 1st square is paired in the 2nd square with 1 in the first row, 2 in the second row, and 3 in the third row.
And 3 is paired with 3 in the first row, 1 in the second row, and 2 in the third row.

If the 2nd square was a duplicate of the 1st, they would not be orthogonal, because each integer would be paired with
itself three times.

Example of Euler Square of size 5:
[[5, 2, 4, 1, 3],      [[5, 1, 2, 3, 4],
 [4, 1, 3, 5, 2],       [4, 5, 1, 2, 3],
 [3, 5, 2, 4, 1],       [3, 4, 5, 1, 2],
 [2, 4, 1, 3, 5],       [2, 3, 4, 5, 1],
 [1, 3, 5, 2, 4]]       [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]

Explanation: 1 in the 1st square is paired in successive rows of the 2nd square with 3, 5, 2, 4, 1. The reader is
invited to verify that 2,3,4 and 5 in the 1st square are also paired with 1-5 in some order in the 2nd square.

NOTE: It turns out doing this for even n is much harder. This might be the subject of a future kata.

 Even Euler didn't!")
